OverviewArtificial intelligence has great effect on modern   lives.   In this coursework,   the theme   on   framework design   of new   medical image-based   bias-mitigated and fair computer-aided diagnosis   system   will   be   investigated   and explored. The coursework consists of two parts. In Part   1, you   need to   complete   a   report   based   given   theme. In Part 2, you   need to explain your   design via   video   presentation.
Part   1 (Individual   Report: 70   marks)Healthcare   industry is   rich of electronic   (digital)   medical data from different   modalities.   Deep   learning   has   revolutionized the   use of machine   learning   in   healthcare   industry   by   leveraging on the   model’s   automatic   feature   extraction   and   learning.   To   date,   deep   models   have   been   applied   for   numerous   computer-aided   diagnosis   tasks such as prediction, detection and classification. Despite its promising outlook, deep learning-   based   computer-aided   diagnosis   models   still   fail   to   earn   the   trust   of   medical   doctors.   In   fact,   there   are   reports   of   inaccurate   missed   diagnoses   due   to   bias   error,   lack   of   understanding   about   the   underlying   mechanism   of deep   learning,   and   miscalibration   in   real   practice. Therefore,   there   is   an   open   call   for   fair   and transparent computer-aided diagnosis model for trustworthy smart healthcare.The aim of this task is to empirically   assess   the   current   status   of   computer-aided   diagnosis,   technologies,   challenges   and   solutions   in   smart   healthcare,   and   research questions   in AI fairness to   design   a   towards   innovative      bias-mitigated      and    fair      deep       learning      medical      image-based      computer-aided   diagnosis model framework design with predefined traits. Hence, you are required to equip yourselves   with   the   understanding   about   the   specific   domain   of   medical   imaging.   Besides,   you   need   to   apply   the knowledge   acquired   from   the   lectures   and   tutorials   to   complete   this   coursework.   You   also   need   to   do   literature review to identify further relevant   information that   is   helpful to   develop your   report   content.
Task Instructions:
(1)   You are required to study the medical image-based artificial intelligence   computer-aided   diagnosis   by   using   deep   learning   in   smart   healthcare   domain.   Therefore,   literature   review   is   needed.   For   beginner,   you   can      refer   to   the   suggested    review    paper   to    understand   the   domain   of   smart   healthcare using AI:
Most   Nilufa   Yeasmin, Md   Al   Amin, Tasmim   Jamal   Jati, Zeyar   Aung    Mohammad   Abdul   Azim. 2024. Advanced   of   AI   in   Image-Based   Computer-Aided   Diagnosis: A   Review.

代做程序编程语言16/j.array.2024.10035Moreover, you are   required to study extra   learning   materials to familiarize yourselves with   image-   based computer-aided diagnosis by using deep   learning.   Please   note that   no   mark will   be given   to   the   literature   review   nor   content   extract   from   the   given   review   paper.   However,   this   effort   shall   serve as your first steep for your proposed towards innovative   bias-mitigated and fair   deep   learning medical image-based computer-aided diagnosis   model framework design.
(2)   Write a report on your proposed towards   innovative   bias-mitigated and fair   deep   learning   medical   image-based   computer-aided   diagnosis   model   framework   design.   The   report   should   be   written   in   a   clear   and   concise   manner   with   no   more   than   1,500 words+/-5%.   in   total length.   Your   final   report   should   be   detailed,   relevant   and   rationale   in   addressing   the   following   sections:Important:    Do      not      repeat      existing      information   that      is      in      the      research      papers.   This   will   only contribute   to   low   mark.   Instead, you   need to   synthesize your   own   ideas/opinions   based   on your   understanding and present them   in your own words.
Part   2 (Individual   Presentation: 30 marks)   Task Instructions:
(1)   Prepare   and   record   a   short   individual   presentation   video   of   5   minutes+/-5%. Your   presentation should   be clear, should be in no   more   than   10   Powerpoint   slides   and   should   not   take   beyond   5 minutes+/-5%. The   presentation   should   address   the   followings:
i.                         To   introduce   and   explain   the   significance   of your   proposed towards   innovative   bias-   mitigated       and       fair       deep       learning         medical         image-based       computer-aided   diagnosis   model framework design.
ii.                         To      explain      how      your      proposed      model      design      can      effectively      become      General      DataProtection   Regulation   (GDPR) and   IEEE “Human   Standards” with   Implications   for   AI   compliance    in   order   to   promote   your   design   to   overseas    healthcare      market   successfully.
